    "## Introduction \n",
    "This notebook is part of the IBM data science capstone project. In this project we will be using data from the foursquare api as well as official crime data from government websites to see relationships between the type of businesses in an area and there effect on the crime rate. This can be used to get some insights on the factors that lead to crime and why certain neighborhoods can have lower crime rates based on the businesses that are running in that area. This data study can be of interest to local authorities to have a way to predict the impacts a new business might have on the surrounding area. Additionally, this data can be of interest to anyone looking to startup a business as they look for the best location to start at. "
